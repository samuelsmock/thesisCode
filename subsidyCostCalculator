## This program is very similar to the npvCalculator, except instead of calculating a discounted NPV for building owners,
## it calculates the potential cost to the government of subsidies and price brake guarantees, specifically between scenario 2 
## and scenario 3. The details of these are found in priceDict, and must be changed there if required. Scenario 2 cooresponds to a 
## price guarantee at current price levels and scenario 3 cooresponds to a roughly linear increase in heat pump tariffs to 34 cents
## in 2044. See (BWP, 2022) and Pehnt et. al. 2023 for more details
